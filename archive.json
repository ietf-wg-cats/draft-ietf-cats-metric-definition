It names the new mechanism AMetric. \r\nSome should be noted that:\r\n\r\n- these generic metrics typically refer to network metrics as described in Section 2 of draft-ietf-lsr-flex-algo-bw-con-15:\r\n\"The Traffic Engineering Default Metric is defined in [RFC5305] and [RFC3630] and the Min Unidirectional delay metric is defined in [RFC8570] and [RFC7471]. Other metrics, such as jitter, reliability, and fiscal cost may be helpful, depending on the traffic class.\"\r\n\r\n- These two drafts are more on metric exposure and metric distribution rather than the definition of new metrics.\r\n- As mentioned in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-generic-metric/ , it keeps emphasizing accumulation which should be compared with aggregation that mentioned in our drafts. \r\n- Similarly, it has a definition on normalized bit(Section 5) and which component does normalization(Section 8), and the way to use this normalized value(Section 8 and 9). I think we should refer to this part when we consider to define our normalized CATS metrics.\r\n- As Cheng mentioned above and also Lindar mentioned in the list, there are some other documents describing CATS related metrics and ways to exposure. We should also look into these docs and put them into the same discussion thread.    ",

L2 from C-SMA is for instance selection considering compute domain metrics only. So can they be simply summed up at the Ingress(C-PS)? If not, will there be a simple derivation and generation of another value(L3 metric)?. I'm not recommending we should have a L3 abstraction, but try to understand such case.

A network is a specific object. Networks also could involve several devices, some of them not related to communication. The key properties here are compute and communication.

For instance, computing refers to a general class of metrics (CPU clock rate, tflops, etc.), but \"delay\" is a specific type of metric. Further, delay could be applicable to both compute and communication metrics, so it overlaps with them, confusing the taxonomy.\r\n\r\nI like to think of metrics organized on three broad types of classes depending on the \"state of data\":\r\n\r\n(1) Data can be processed using a compute resource.\r\n(2) Data can be transferred using a communication resource.\r\n(3) Data can be at rest (not being processed and not being transferred) by keeping it in a storage device.\r\n\r\nThis leads to 3 broad classes of metrics IMO:\r\n\r\n(1) Compute metrics.\r\n(2) Communication metrics.\r\n(3) Storage metrics.\r\n\r\nDelay is a specific property, so it does not belong to the same level of the above three classes.

              "body": "Hi, Jordi, thanks for your further clarification on data-oriented classfication. In the third category you mentioned\"storage device\". Here \"storage device\", does it refer to a storage server or storage unit inside a server? And what do you think \"memory\" should belong to? Does it belong to compute metrics or storage metrics? because the word \"process\" itself is complicated to define. if following a Von Neumann pattern, then memory should be part of the \"processing\", right?\r\n\r\nIn terms of delay, yes, it doesn't belong to the three categories above. It's special, because it can be applied to describe metrics from other categories. For example, FLOPS, if it is multiplied by a delay, you can count the total number of operations. So I'm thinking if we can treat delay as well as any other metric that can be described by delay, can be a pair **<metric_1, delay>**. Even the storage metric can also be paired with delay to calculate how much space it will be occupied.  \r\n\r\nThe metric pair describes: \r\n* The capability of the object--<metric_1>\r\n* How long it will be useful-- < delay >\r\n* The total amount--< product of metric_1 and delay>  serves as a further factor for instance selection decision making \r\n\r\nGoing back to the metric framework, L0 doesn't need to be classified. The only question is should we put delay at L1. Just as I have described, maybe we can put delay as a seperate class which can be paired with other classes. We may need some text to explain it. Do you think it reasonable?",
