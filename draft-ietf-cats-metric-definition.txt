Abstract

   Computing-Aware Traffic Steering (CATS) is a traffic engineering
   approach that optimizes the steering of traffic to a given service
   instance by considering the dynamic nature of computing and network
   resources.  In order to consider the computing and network resources,
   a system needs to share information (metrics) that describes the
   state of the resources.  Metrics from network domain have been in use
   in network systems for a long time.  This document defines a set of
   metrics from the computing domain used for CATS.>

1.  Introduction

   Service providers are deploying computing capabilities across the
   network for hosting applications such as distributed AI workloads,
   AR/VR and driverless vehicles, among others.  In these deployments,
   multiple service instances are replicated across various sites to
   ensure sufficient capacity for maintaining the required Quality of
   Experience (QoE) expected by the application.  To support the
   selection of these instances, a framework called Computing-Aware
   Traffic Steering (CATS) is introduced in [I-D.ietf-cats-framework].

   CATS is a traffic engineering approach that optimizes the steering of
   traffic to a given service instance by considering the dynamic nature
   of computing and network resources.  To achieve this, CATS components
   require performance metrics for both communication and compute
   resources.  Since these resources are deployed by multiple providers,
   standardized metrics are essential to ensure interoperability and
   enable precise traffic steering decisions, thereby optimizing
   resource utilization and enhancing overall system performance.

   Metrics from network domain have already been defined in previous
   documents, e.g., RFC 9439, RFC 8912，and RFC 8911, and been in use in
   network systems for a long time.  This document focuses on
   categorizing the relevant metrics at the computing domain for CATS
   into three levels based on their complexity and granularity.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   This document uses the following terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-cats-framework]:

   *  Computing-Aware Traffic Steering (CATS)

   *  Service

   *  Service contact instance

3.  Definition of Metrics

   Introducing a definition of metrics requires balancing the following
   trade-off: if the metrics are too fine-grained, they become
   unscalable due to the excessive number of metrics that must be
   communicated through the metrics distribution protocol.  (See
   [I-D.rcr-opsawg-operational-compute-metrics] for a discussion of
   metrics distribution protocols.)  Conversely, if the metrics are too
   coarse-grained, they may not have sufficient information to enable
   proper operational decisions.  To ensure scalability while providing
   sufficient detail for effective decision-making, this document
   provides a definition of metrics that incorporates three levels of
   abstraction:

   *  *Level 0 (L0): Raw metrics.* These metrics are presented without
      abstraction, with each metric using its own unit and format as
      defined by the underlying resource.

   *  *Level 1 (L1): Metrics normalized within categories.* These
      metrics are derived by aggregating L0 metrics into multiple
      categories, such as network and computing.  Each category is
      summarized with a single L1 metric by normalizing it into a value
      within a defined range of scores.

   *  *Level 2 (L2): Fully normalized metric.* These metrics are derived
      by aggregating lower level metrics (L0 or L1) into a single L2
      metric, which is then normalized into a value within a defined
      range of scores.

3.1.  Level 0: Raw Metrics

   Level 0 metrics encompass detailed, raw metrics, including but not
   limited to:

   *  CPU: Base Frequency, boosted frequency, number of cores, core
      utilization, memory bandwidth, memory size, memory utilization,
      power consumption.

   *  GPU: Frequency, number of render units, memory bandwidth, memory
      size, memory utilization, core utilization, power consumption.

   *  NPU: Computing power, utilization, power consumption.

   *  Network: Bandwidth, capacity, throughput, bytes transmitted, bytes
      received, host bus utilization.

   *  Storage: Available space, read speed, write speed.

   *  Delay: Time taken to process a request.

   L0 metrics serve as foundational data and do not require
   classification.  They provide basic information to support higher-
   level metrics, as detailed in the following sections.

   L0 metrics can be encoded and exposed using an Application
   Programming Interface (API), such as a RESTful API, and can be
   solution-specific.  Different resources can have their own metrics,
   each conveying unique information about their status.  These metrics
   can generally have units, such as bits per second (bps) or floating
   point instructions per second (flops).

   Regarding network-related information, [RFC8911] and [RFC8912] define
   various performance metrics and their registries.  Additionally, in
   [RFC9439], the ALTO WG introduced an extended set of metrics related
   to network performance, such as throughput and delay.  For compute
   metrics, [I-D.rcr-opsawg-operational-compute-metrics] lists a set of
   cloud resource metrics.

3.2.  Level 1: Normalized Metrics in Categories

   L1 metrics are organized into distinct categories, such as computing,
   communication, and composed metrics.  Each L0 metric is classified
   into one of these categories.  Within each category, a single L1
   metric is computed using an _aggregation function_ and normalized to
   a unitless score that represents the performance of the underlying
   resources according to that category.  Potential categories include:

   *  *Computing:* A normalized value derived from computing-related L0
      metrics, such as CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization.

   *  *Communication:* A normalized value derived from communication-
      related L0 metrics, such as communication throughput.

   *  *Composed:* A normalized value derived from an end-to-end
      aggregation function by levaraging both computing and
      communication metrics.  For example, end-to-end delay computed as
      the sum of all delays along a path.

   Editor note: detailed categories can be updated according to the CATS
   WG discussion.

   L0 metrics, such as those defined in [RFC8911], [RFC8912], [RFC9439],
   and [I-D.rcr-opsawg-operational-compute-metrics], can be categorized
   into the aforementioned categories.  Each category will employ its
   own aggregation function (e.g., weighted summary) to generate the
   normalized value.  This approach allows the protocol to focus solely
   on the metric categories and their normalized values, thereby
   avoiding the need to process solution-specific detailed metrics.

3.3.  Level 2: Fully Normalized Metric.

   The L2 metric is a single score value derived from the lower level
   metrics (L0 or L1) using an aggregation function.  Different
   implementations may employ different aggregation functions to
   characterize the overall performance of the underlying compute and
   communication resources.  The definition of the L2 metric simplifies
   the complexity of collecting and distributing numerous lower-level
   metrics by consolidating them into a single, unified score.

   TODO: Some implementations may support the configuration of Ingress
   CATS-Forwarders with the metric normalizing method so that it can
   decode the information from the L1 or L0 metrics.

   Figure 1 provides a summary of the logical relationships between
   metrics across the three levels of abstraction.

4.  Representation of Metrics

   The representation of metrics is a key component of the CATS
   architecture.  It defines how metrics are encoded and transmitted
   over the network.  The representation should be flexible enough to
   accommodate various types of metrics along with their respective
   units and precision levels, yet simple enough to enable easy
   implementation and deployment across heterogeneous edge environments.

4.1.  CATS Metric Fields

   This section presents the detailed representation of CATS metrics.
   The design aligns with principles established in similar IETF
   specifications, such as the network performance metrics defined in
   [RFC9439].

   A CATS metric is represented using a set of fields, each describing a
   property of the metric.  This document introduces the following CATS
   metrics fields:

   - Cats_metric:
         - Metric_type:
               The type of the CATS metric.
               Examples: compute_cpu, storage_disk_size, network_bw,
               compute_delay, network_delay, compute_norm,
               storage_norm, network_norm, delay_norm.
         - Format:
               The encoding format of the metric.
               Examples: int, float.
         - Format_std (optional):
               The standard used to encode and decode the value
               field according to the format field.
               Example: ieee_754, ascii.
         - Length:
               The size of the value field measured in octets.
               Examples: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.
         - Unit:
               The unit of this metric.
               Examples: mhz, ghz, byte, kbyte, mbyte,
               gbyte, bps, kbps, mbps, gbps, tbps, tflops, none.
         - Source (optional):
               The source of information used to obtain the value field.
               Examples: nominal, estimation, normalization,
               aggregation.
         - Statistics(optional):
               The statistical function used to obtain the value field.
               Examples: max, min, mean, cur.
         - Level:
               The level this metric belongs to.
               Examples: L0, L1, L2.
         - Value:
               The value of this metric.
               Examples: 12, 3.2.

                        Figure 2: CATS Metric Fields

   Next, we describe each field in more detail:

   *  *Metric_Type (type)*: This field specifies the category or kind of
      CATS metric being measured, such as computational resources,
      storage capacity, or network bandwidth.  It acts as a label that
      enables network devices to identify the purpose of the metric.

   *  *Format (format)*: This field indicates the data encoding format
      of the metric, such as whether the value is represented as an
      integer, a floating-point number, or has no specific format.

   *  *Format standard (format_std, optional)*: This optional field
      indicates the standard used to encode and decode the value field
      according to the format field.  It is only required if the value
      field is encoded using a specific standard, and knowing this
      standard is necessary to decode the value field.  Examples of
      format standards include ieee_754 and ascii.  This field ensures
      that the value can be accurately interpreted by specifying the
      encoding method used.

   *  *Length (length)*: This field indicates the size of the value
      field measured in octets (bytes).  It specifies how many bytes are
      used to store the value of the metric.  Examples include 4, 8, 16,
      32, and 64.  The length field is important for memory allocation
      and data handling, ensuring that the value is stored and retrieved
      correctly.

   *  *Unit (unit)*: This field defines the measurement units for the
      metric, such as frequency, data size, or data transfer rate.  It
      is usually associated with the metric to provide context for the
      value.

   *  *Source (source, optional)*: This field describes the origin of
      the information used to obtain the metric.  It may include one or
      more of the following non-mutually exclusive values:

      -  'nominal'.  Similar to [RFC9439], "a 'nominal' metric indicates
         that the metric value is statically configured by the
         underlying devices.  For example, bandwidth can indicate the
         maximum transmission rate of the involved device.

      -  'estimation'.  The 'estimation' source indicates that the
         metric value is computed through an estimation process.

      -  'directly measured'.  This source indicates that the metric can
         be obtained directly from the underlying device and it does not
         need to be estimated.

      -  'normalization'.  The 'normalization' source indicates that the
         metric value was normalized.  For instance, a metric could be
         normalized to take a value from 0 to 1, from 0 to 10, or to
         take a percentage value.  This type of metrics do not have
         units.

      -  'aggregation'.  This source indicates that the metric value was
         obtained by using an aggregation function.

      Nominal metrics have inherent physical meanings and specific units
      without any additional processing.  Aggregated metrics may or may
      not have physical meanings, but they retain their significance
      relative to the directly measured metrics.  Normalized metrics, on
      the other hand, might have physical meanings but lack units.

   *  *Statistics (statistics, optional)*: This field provides
      additional details about the metrics, particularly if there is any
      pre-computation performed on the metrics before they are
      collected.  It is useful for services that require specific
      statistics for service instance selection.

      -  'max'.  The maximum value of the data collected over intervals.

      -  'min'.  The minimum value of the data collected over intervals.

      -  'mean'.  The average value of the data collected over
         intervals.

      -  'cur'.  The current value of the data collected.

   *  *Level (level)*: This field specifies the level at which the
      metric is measured.  It is used to categorize the metric based on
      its granularity and scope.  Examples include L0, L1, and L2.  The
      level field helps in understanding the level of detail and
      specificity of the metric being measured.

   *  *Value (value)*: This field represents the actual numerical value
      of the metric being measured.  It provides the specific data point
      for the metric in question.

4.2.  Level 0 Metric Representation

   Several definitions have been developed within the compute and
   communication industries, as well as through various standardization
   efforts---such as those by the [DMTF]---that can serve as L0 metrics.
   This section provides illustrative examples.

4.2.1.  Compute Raw Metrics

   This section uses CPU frequency as an example to illustrate the
   representation of raw compute metrics.  The metric type is labeled as
   compute_CPU_frequency, with the unit specified in GHz.  The format
   should support both unsigned integers and floating-point values.  The
   corresponding metric fields are defined as follows:

   Basic fields:
         Metric Type: compute_CPU_frequency
         Level: L0
         Format: unsigned integer, floating point
         Unit: GHz
         Length: four octets
         Value: 2.2
   Source:
         nominal

   |Metric Type|Level|Format| Unit|Length| Value|Source|
       8bits    2bits  1bit  4bits  3bits 32bits  3bits

                Figure 3: An Example for Compute Raw Metrics

4.2.2.  Communication Raw Metrics

   This section takes the total transmitted bytes (TxBytes) as an
   example to show the representation of communication raw metrics.
   TxBytes are named as "communication type_TxBytes”. The unit is Mega
   Bytes (MB).  Format is unsigned integer or floating point.  It will
   occupy 4 octets.  The source of the metric is "Directly measured" and
   the statistics is "mean".  Example:

   Basic fields:
         Metric type: “communication type_TXBytes”
         Level: L0
         Format: unsigned integer, floating point
         Unit: MB
         Length: four octets
         Value: 100
   Source:
         Directly measured
   Statistics:
         mean

   |Metric Type|Level|Format| Unit|Length| Value|Source|Statistics|
       8bits    2bits  1bit  4bits  3bits 32bits  3bits   2bits

             Figure 4: An Example for Communication Raw Metrics

4.2.3.  Delay Raw Metrics

   Delay is a kind of synthesized metric which is influenced by
   computing, storage access, and network transmission.  Usually delay
   refers to the overal processing duration between the arrival time of
   a specific service request and the departure time of the
   corresponding service response.  It is named as "delay_raw".  The
   format should support both unsigned integer or floating point.  Its
   unit is microseconds, and it occupies 4 octets.  For example:

   Basic fields:
         Metric type: “delay_raw”
         Level: L0
         Format: unsigned integer, floating point
         Unit: Microsecond(us)
         Length: four octets
         Value: 231.5
   Source:
         aggregation
   Statistics:
         max

   |Metric Type|Level|Format| Unit|Length| Value|Source|Statistics|
       8bits    2bits  1bit  4bits  3bits 32bits  3bits   2bits

                 Figure 5: An Example for Delay Raw Metrics

4.3.  Level 1 Metric Representation

   L1 metrics are normalized from L0 metrics.  Although they don't have
   units, they can still be classified into types such as compute,
   communication and composed metrics.  This classification is useful
   because it makes L1 metrics semantically meaningful.

   The sources of L1 metrics is normalization.  Based on L0 metrics,
   service providers design their own algorithms to normalize metrics.
   For example, assigning different cost values to each raw metric and
   do weighted summation.  L1 metrics do not need further statistical
   values.

4.3.1.  Normalized Compute Metrics

   The metric type of normalized compute metrics is “compute_norm”, and
   its format is unsigned integer.  It has no unit.  It will occupy an
   octet.  Example:

   Basic fields:
         Metric type: “compute_norm”
         Level: L1
         Format: unsigned integer
         Length: one octet
         Value: 5
   Source:
         normalization


   |Metric Type|Level|Format|Length|Value|Source|
       8bits    2bits  1bit   3bits 8bits  3bits

            Figure 6: An Example for Normalized Compute Metrics

4.3.2.  Normalized Communication Metrics

   The metric type of normalized communication metrics is
   “communication_norm”, and its format is unsigned integer.  It has no
   unit.  It will occupy an octet.  Example:

   Basic fields:
         Metric type: “communication_norm”
         Level: L1
         Format: unsigned integer
         Length: one octet
         Value: 1
   Source:

4.3.3.  Normalized Composed Metrics

   The metric type of normalized composed metrics is “delay_norm”, and
   its format is unsigned integer.  It has no unit.  It will occupy an
   octet.  Example:

   Basic fields:
         Metric type: “composed_norm”
         Level: L1
         Format: unsigned integer
         Length: an octet
         Value: 8
   Source:

4.4.  Level 2 Metric Representation

   A fully normalized metric is a single value which does not have any
   physical meaning or unit.  Each provider may have its own methods to
   derive the value, but all providers must follow the definition in
   this section to represent the fully normalized value.

   Metric type is “norm_fi”. The format of the value is unsigned
   integer.  It has no unit.  It will occupy an octet.  Example:

   Basic fields:
         Metric type: “norm_fi”
         Level: L2
         Format: unsigned integer
         Length: an octet
         Value: 1
   Source:
         normalization

              Figure 9: An Example for Fully Normalized Metric

   The fully normalized value also supports aggregation when there are
   multiple service instances providing these fully normalized values.
   When providing fully normalized values, service instances do not need
   to do further statistics.

5.  Comparison among Metric Levels

   Metrics are progressively consolidated from L0 to L1 to L2, with each
   level offering a different degree of abstraction to address the
   diverse requirements of various services.  Table 1 provides a
   comparative overview of these metric levels.

      +=======+=============+===============+===========+==========+
      | Level | Encoding    | Extensibility | Stability | Accuracy |
      |       | Complexity  |               |           |          |
      +=======+=============+===============+===========+==========+
      | Level | Complicated | Bad           | Bad       | Good     |
      |   0   |             |               |           |          |
      +-------+-------------+---------------+-----------+----------+
      | Level | Medium      | Medium        | Medium    | Medium   |
      |   1   |             |               |           |          |
      +-------+-------------+---------------+-----------+----------+
      | Level | Simple      | Good          | Good      | Medium   |
      |   2   |             |               |           |          |
      +-------+-------------+---------------+-----------+----------+

                 Table 1: Comparison among Metrics Levels

   Since Level 0 metrics are raw and service-specific, different
   services may define their own sets—potentially resulting in hundreds
   or even thousands of unique metrics.  This diversity introduces
   significant complexity in protocol encoding and standardization.
   Consequently, L0 metrics are generally confined to bespoke
   implementations tailored to specific service needs, rather than being
   standardized for broad protocol use.  In contrast, Level 1 metrics
   organize raw data into standardized categories, each normalized into
   a single value.  This structure makes them more suitable for protocol
   encoding and standardization.  Level 2 metrics take simplification a
   step further by consolidating all relevant information into a single
   normalized value, making them the easiest to encode, transmit, and
   standardize.

   Therefore, from the perspective of encoding complexity, Level 1 and
   Level 2 metrics are recommended.

   When considering extensibility, Level 0 metrics allow new services to
   define their own custom metrics.  However, this flexibility requires
   corresponding protocol extensions, and the proliferation of metric
   types can introduce significant overhead, ultimately reducing the
   protocol’s extensibility.  In contrast, Level 1 metrics introduce
   only a limited set of standardized categories, making protocol
   extensions more manageable.  Level 2 metrics go even further by
   consolidating all information into a single normalized value, placing
   the least burden on the protocol.

   Therefore, from an extensibility standpoint, Level 1 and Level 2
   metrics are recommended.

   Regarding stability, Level 0 raw metrics may require frequent
   protocol extensions as new metrics are introduced, leading to an
   unstable and evolving protocol format.  For this reason,
   standardizing L0 metrics within the protocol is not recommended.  In
   contrast, Level 1 metrics involve only a limited set of predefined
   categories, and Level 2 metrics rely on a single consolidated value,
   both of which contribute to a more stable and maintainable protocol
   design.

   Therefore, from a stability standpoint, Level 1 and Level 2 metrics
   are preferred.

   In conclusion, for CATS, Level 2 metrics are recommended due to their
   simplicity and minimal protocol overhead.  If more advanced
   scheduling capabilities are required, Level 1 metrics offer a
   balanced approach with manageable complexity.  While Level 0 metrics
   are the most detailed and dynamic, their high overhead makes them
   unsuitable for direct transmission to network devices and thus not
   recommended for standard protocol integration.

6.  Implementation Guidance on Using CATS Metrics

   This section provides implementation guidance and outlines options
   for service providers and vendors on how to utilize CATS metrics
   effectively.  The goal is to promote interoperability while ensuring
   optimal performance, particularly when L2 metrics are used for
   decision-making.

   As described in the CATS framework [I-D.ietf-cats-framework], the
   architecture includes multiple CATS components with varying
   functionalities, resource constraints, and processing capabilities.
   These differences must be carefully considered when determining where
   to place the normalization and aggregation functions used to derive
   L2 metrics.

   A key design principle is to offload normalization and aggregation
   functions from the decision-making component---the CATS Path Selector
   (C-PS)---especially when the C-PS is co-located with CATS-Forwarders.
   Based on this principle, normalization and aggregation functions can
   be deployed at the Service Contact Instance or the CATS Service
   Metric Agent (C-SMA).

   However, since the C-SMA may be co-located with CATS-Forwarders,
   which often have limited processing resources, placing normalization
   functions there could introduce significant overhead and negatively
   impact routing efficiency.  Therefore, this document recommends
   placing aggregation functions at the C-SMA, while both normalization
   and aggregation functions can be implemented at the Service Contact
   Instance.

   Given that Service Contact Instances and C-SMAs may be provided by
   different vendors, it is essential to agree on common normalization
   and aggregation functions for traffic steering.  Without such
   alignment, instance selection may become inconsistent or inaccurate.

   Editor's Note: Additional implementation considerations will be added
   progressively.  This draft will be updated in alignment with ongoing
   discussions on metric definitions within the CATS Working Group.
